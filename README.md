# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project defines a class ItemTracker that tracks the frequency of items read from a file. It has methods to load input from a file, save the frequency data to a file, get the frequency of a specific item, and print the frequency of all items and an item histogram.

The problem it solves is to read a list of items from a file, track the frequency of each item, and provide functionality to query and visualize the frequency data. The main function creates an ItemTracker instance, loads the input file, and then provides a menu-driven interface to interact with the ItemTracker object, allowing the user to query and visualize the item frequency data.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did several things well in the program including modular design, file handling, map usage, menu-driven interface. 
I structured my code into a class ItemTracker, which encapsulates the functionality related to tracking item frequencies. This makes the code organized and easier to maintain. My program effectively reads input from a file and saves frequency data to a file using ifstream and ofstream classes. This demonstrates a good understanding of file handling in C++.
I used the std::map container to efficiently store item frequencies. This is a suitable choice as it allows quick retrieval and update of frequency counts. My use of a do-while loop and a switch statement to create a menu-driven interface is a good approach for user interaction. It provides a clear and structured way for users to interact with your program.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
